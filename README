Fdbup is an F# script that you can use for deploying and upgrading SQL databases.

It is based heavily on the dbup project (see: http://code.google.com/p/dbup/).

Instructions
------------
1. Make sure the database you wish to execute the scripts on has been created.
2. Have the SQL scripts you wish to execute in a specific directory, making sure that the scripts are named with numbers to put them in the right execution order (eg. Script0001.sql, Script0002.sql...).
3. Execute "fsi path connectionString versionTable"
	- fsi: F# interactive interpreter.
	- path: path to the SQL scripts you wish to execute.
	- connectionString: database you wish to execute the scripts on.
	- versionTable: SQL table that stores what scripts have been executed.
